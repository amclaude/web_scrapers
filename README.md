### Sample Outputs

You can find the sample outputs in the folder **sample_data**. If you want something in csv you can just do it by yourself XD.

### Want to get the social media profiles of a website?

Get Facebook, twitter, instagram and tiktok url of a website usin [LinkScout](https://linkscout-zeta.vercel.app). It still doesn't have a support for proxies so you might encounter some access denied or similar errors while scraping. Even though this is not 100% it will still be a good starting point
